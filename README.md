## 🚀 News
- **2025.11.29** — Code released.
- **2025.11.27** — DuOcc paper has been updated on **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22087)**.

## ✨ Highlights
- **DuOcc** introduces a **dual aggregation strategy** combining *Stream-based Voxel Feature Aggregation (StreamAgg)* and *Query-guided Feature Aggregation (QueryAgg)* for efficient and high-fidelity 3D occupancy prediction.
- Achieves **state-of-the-art performance**:
  - **Occ3D-nuScenes**: 41.9 mIoU (**+2.3** over prior SOTA / in real-time setting)
  - **SurroundOcc dataset**: 23.0 mIoU (**+1.1** over prior SOTA)
- Runs within real-time constraints (**83 ms**) and requires only **2.8 GB** of GPU memory — **over 40% less memory** than competing approaches.


## 💡 Method
![Method](./assets/overview.png)

DuOcc is composed of two complementary components:

### Stream-based Voxel Feature Aggregation (StreamAgg)
- Aligns and aggregates voxel features over time using motion-aware warping.
- Reduces warping artifacts via a lightweight refinement module (RefineNet).
- Preserves spatially coherent geometry and is particularly effective for static structures, whose positions remain stable after ego-motion compensation—making them inherently suitable for stream-based accumulation.
### Query-guided Feature Aggregation (QueryAgg)
- Extracts semantics of dynamic objects from image features and encodes them into propagated instance queries.
- Injects these instance-level query features into the corresponding voxel regions.
- Complements fine-grained dynamic object details that are difficult to capture through voxel accumulation alone due to motion-induced misalignment, occlusion, or sparse projection.

**StreamAgg and QueryAgg jointly produce a fast, memory-efficient, and high-fidelity 3D occupancy representation.**

</p>

DuOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on Occ3D-nuScenes (**41.9 mIoU**) and SurroundOcc Dataset(**23.0 mIoU**), while running at **83 ms** and using only **2.8 GB** of memory, making it one of the most efficient high-performing occupancy prediction models available. These results highlight DuOcc’s strong balance of **accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency**, making it highly suitable for real-world autonomous driving.
