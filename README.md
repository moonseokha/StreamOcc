## Framework
![Framework](./figs/teaser.pdf)
(a) Our proposed model, called StreamOcc, which predicts the semantic 3D occupancy states using sequentially incoming image data. Our approach accumulates voxel features in a stream-based manner while directly aggregating instance-level features of dynamic objects into corresponding voxel features. (b) showing state-of-the-art performance with higher occupancy prediction accuracy and lower computational costs, i.e., memory usage and running time.
